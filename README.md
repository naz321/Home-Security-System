# Home-Security-System
The home security system is a model of a real-life alarm system used to track any noise/motion within a home. It was designed by connecting a MSP430 Launchpad to a breadboard. 
It triggers four different zones using reed switches as well as a mic and amp. 
It utilizes an audio transducer in order to sound an alarm and also allows users to interact with the system through a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter.
