# Home-Security-System
This project models a real world alarm system used to track any noise/motion within a home. It was designed using a MSP430 Launchpad.
It triggers four different zones using reed switches and a mic & amp. 
It utilizes an audio transducer in order to sound an alarm and also allows users to interact with the system through a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter.
